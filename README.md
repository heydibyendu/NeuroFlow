# NeuroFlow Data Team Take-Home Project

The goal of our analysis is to derive insights around the data from GAD-7 validated assessments, which is used to aid in the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder as well as screen for panic, socialanxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder.

# Assumptions
* I am assuming that the score truly represents the metal state of the patients and the patients responded honestly to each quention.
* Iâ€™m also assuming that every patient went through the questions with the same sequence with uniform time interval.
